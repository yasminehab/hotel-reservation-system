# Hotel Reservation System

This project is a responsive React application for a hotel reservation system. Users can view available rooms, filter and sort them, and make reservations.

## Features

- View available hotel rooms
- Filter rooms by price range and room type
- Sort rooms by price or room type
- Select check-in and check-out dates
- Book rooms (for authenticated users)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

## Redux store limitations

The booked dates of rooms were difficult to manage due to the structure of the Redux store.
Synchronizing the booked dates in the store with the calendar to disable unavailable dates was challenging.
As a result, the availability calendar doesn't fully reflect real-time booking changes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Npm install
3. Npm start
